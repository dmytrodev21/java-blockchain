### ðŸ”¥ **Features**  
âœ… **Blockchain Implementation** â€“ Each block contains transactions and is linked securely using cryptographic hashes.  
âœ… **Proof-of-Work (Mining)** â€“ Blocks require computational work (mining) before being added to the chain.  
âœ… **Digital Wallets** â€“ Users can generate wallets with public and private keys for secure transactions.  
âœ… **Transactions & UTXOs** â€“ Uses the **Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** model for secure and verifiable transfers.  
âœ… **Security & Digital Signatures** â€“ Transactions are signed using **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**.  
âœ… **Chain Validation** â€“ Ensures blockchain integrity by verifying transaction history and preventing fraud.  
âœ… **Interactive CLI** â€“ Users can send, receive, and verify transactions through an interactive console.  
âœ… **GitHub Integration** â€“ Easily deploy and collaborate with version control.

### ðŸ“Œ **How It Works**
1. **Genesis Block Creation** â€“ The first block is mined and added to the blockchain.  
2. **Wallet Setup** â€“ Users create digital wallets to store NiCoins.  
3. **Transaction Processing** â€“ Users send NiCoins using **public-private key encryption**.  
4. **Mining & Block Addition** â€“ Transactions are verified, mined, and appended to the blockchain.  
5. **Chain Validation** â€“ Ensures all transactions and blocks follow the blockchain rules.

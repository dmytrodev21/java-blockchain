# NiCoin
## 🪙 NiCoin - A Simple Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency  

**NiCoin** is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency implemented in **Java** using **IntelliJ IDEA**. It provides a simple yet functional demonstration of **blockchain mechanics**, including **transaction verification, proof-of-work mining, wallets, and digital signatures**.  

---

### 🔥 **Features**  
✅ **Blockchain Implementation** – Each block contains transactions and is linked securely using cryptographic hashes.  
✅ **Proof-of-Work (Mining)** – Blocks require computational work (mining) before being added to the chain.  
✅ **Digital Wallets** – Users can generate wallets with public and private keys for secure transactions.  
✅ **Transactions & UTXOs** – Uses the **Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)** model for secure and verifiable transfers.  
✅ **Security & Digital Signatures** – Transactions are signed using **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**.  
✅ **Chain Validation** – Ensures blockchain integrity by verifying transaction history and preventing fraud.  
✅ **Interactive CLI** – Users can send, receive, and verify transactions through an interactive console.  
✅ **GitHub Integration** – Easily deploy and collaborate with version control.

### 📌 **How It Works**
1. **Genesis Block Creation** – The first block is mined and added to the blockchain.  
2. **Wallet Setup** – Users create digital wallets to store NiCoins.  
3. **Transaction Processing** – Users send NiCoins using **public-private key encryption**.  
4. **Mining & Block Addition** – Transactions are verified, mined, and appended to the blockchain.  
5. **Chain Validation** – Ensures all transactions and blocks follow the blockchain rules.
